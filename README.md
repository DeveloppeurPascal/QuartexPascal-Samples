# Demo projects for Quartex Pascal IDE (QTX)

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

This code repository contains website, web application, and back-office projects created as demos or for feature testing in Quartex Pascal IDE.

[Quartex Pascal IDE](https://quartexdeveloper.com) is a development environment that allows you to create web applications in the same way you develop software in [Delphi](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/delphi.html) or [Lazarus IDE](https://developpeur-pascal.fr/lazarus.html): you have a screen designer, you code in Pascal, which you can mix with JavaScript. The IDE gives you access to everything you need for web development.

## Talks and conferences

### Twitch

Follow my development streams of software, video games, mobile applications and websites on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or as replays on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr) mostly in French.

## Compatibility

I'm a Quartex Pascal IDE license owner. I use latest version of this web developer tool and libraries.

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it.

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://codeberg.org/PatrickPremartin/QuartexPascal-Samples/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
